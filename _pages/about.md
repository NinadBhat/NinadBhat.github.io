I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at [Springboards.ai](https://springboards.ai/), where I focus on benchmarking and fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for creative applications. My work involves evaluating LLM performance, ensuring high-quality and diverse responses, and improving output through prompt engineering and custom fine-tuning. I'm particularly interested in enhancing response variation, coherence, and creativity in generative tasks.

Previously, I completed a PhD in Applied Machine Learning at the Australian National University, where I built tools for materials design using AI. I've worked as a Software Engineer at the [Software Innovation Institute](https://sii.anu.edu.au/) and [Instaclustr by NetApp](https://www.instaclustr.com/), and held research internships at [IAS-9, Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ias/ias-9) in Germany and [Nanocube](https://www.nanocube.com.au/) in Australia. I hold a Bachelor's and Master's degree from IIT Bombay.

I always look forward to discussing new ideas and exploring potential collaborations. Feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:bhat.ninad@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ninad-bhat/).
